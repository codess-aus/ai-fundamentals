### 1. Identify regression machine learning scenarios
Example: Predicting the online sales volume for the next financial quarter by using historical sales volume data and holiday seasons, pre-orders etc

In a regression ML scenario you predict a numeric value, typically in a continuous form.


### 2. Identify classification machine learning scenarios
Example: Check whether newly arrived emails contain spam.

Classification is used to make predictions in a non-continuous form. Learning from labeled data to classify new observations.


### 3. Identify clustering machine learning scenarios
Example: To learn about purchasing habits of ecommerce clients.

Clustering analyzes data to find similarities in data points and groups them together using unlabelled data.
