# Describe Artificial Intelligence workloads and considerations (15-20%)

## Identify features of common AI workloads
* identify prediction/forecasting workloads
* identify features of anomaly detection workloads
* identify computer vision workloads
* identify natural language processing or knowledge mining workloads
* identify conversational AI workloads

## Identify guiding principles for responsible AI
* describe considerations for fairness in an AI solution
* describe considerations for reliability and safety in an AI solution
* describe considerations for privacy and security in an AI solution
* describe considerations for inclusiveness in an AI solution
* describe considerations for transparency in an AI solution
* describe considerations for accountability in an AI solution

### Example of a Forecasting AI Workload:
Predicting whether an airplane arrives early, on-time or late. A ML model analyzes patterns in the data: Departure time, weather conditions, air-traffic volumes and associates historical patterns to predict or forecast the possible outcome.

### Example of NLP Workload:
Detecting the language in the provided text document. The ML model evaluates the text input and returns the language with a score between 0 and 1 to reflect it's confidence.

### Example of a Conversational AI Workload: 
Providing answers to a customer in a chatbot dialog. A chatbot backend processes input for a customer and sends back answers based on a knowledge base.

### Example of a Computer Vision Workload:
Detecting predestrians in the real-time video stream of an autonomous vehicle. Returns bounding box coordinates for pedestrians.
