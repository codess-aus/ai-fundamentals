### 1. Identify features and uses for key phrase extraction
Example: Identifies the main points in a set of blog posts

Key phrase extraction performs better on larger amounts of text. The more text you provide, the better it will do. Give it an essay.

### 2. Identify features and uses for entity recognition
Named entity recognition identifies entities in a provided test and categorizes them into predefined classes or types such as people, products, events etc. 

### 3. Identify features and uses for sentiment analysis
Sentiment Analysis performs better on smaller amounts of text. Less words means less distractors for the sentiment analysis model, and for that reason, it produces a higher-quality result with smaller amounts of text. Give it some tweets.

Sentiment Analysis returns sentiment labels and scores for the entire document.

Sentiment Analysis returns sentiment labels and scores for each sentence within a document.

Confidence scores range from 0 to 1.

Sentiment Analysis evaluates a provided text for detecting positive or negative sentiments. It then returns sentiment labels and confidence scores, which range from 0 to 1, at the sentence and document levels. While it can detect sentiment in blog posts it cannot identify the main points in them.

### 4. Identify features and uses for language modeling

### 5. Identify features and uses for speech recognition and synthesis
SSML is based on XML as per the WWWC standard. SSML lets you improve the quality of speech synthesis by fine-tuning the pitch, pronounciation, speaking rates and other parameters of the text-to-speech output.

Speech synthesis can generate human-like synthesized speech based on input text. Speech synthesis is available in several languages and can be customised to adjust pitch, add pauses, improve pronounciation etc. by using speech synthesis markup language (SSML). 

Speech recognition recognises and transcribes human speech.

### 6. Identify features and uses for translation

Speech translation provides real-time, multi-lingual translation of audio files or streams.

### 7. Identify capabilities of the Text Analytics service

### 8. Identify capabilities of the Language Understanding Intelligence Service (LUIS)

### 9. Identify capabilities of the Speech service

### 10. Identify capabilities of the Translator Text service
