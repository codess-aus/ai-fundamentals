### Example of a Forecasting AI Workload:
Predicting whether an airplane arrives early, on-time or late. A ML model analyzes patterns in the data: Departure time, weather conditions, air-traffic volumes and associates historical patterns to predict or forecast the possible outcome.

Predicting whether a customer would buy certain items based on their purchase history. ML model analyzes patterns in the previous purchase history to predict the likelihood of a customer buying certain items.

Predicting whether customers should be targeted in a new marketing campaign.

### Example of NLP Workload:
Detecting the language in the provided text document. The ML model evaluates the text input and returns the language with a score between 0 and 1 to reflect it's confidence.

Analyzing customer feedback on an ecommerce website to determine whether it is positive or negative. An ML model evaluates the content of the provided feedback and returns sentiment labels and confidence scores for each sentence and overall content.

Extracting key phrases from student essays. Discards non-essential words and returns single terms or phrases that appear to be the subject or the object of the relevant sentences.

### Example of a Conversational AI Workload: 
Providing answers to a customer in a chatbot dialog. A chatbot backend processes input for a customer and sends back answers based on a knowledge base.

Chatbot answers common customer questions.

Using graphics and menu's to improve the user experience with an ecommerce websites chatbot. The chatbot's functionality is extended beyond the default text interface with more interactive components such as graphics, menu's and buttons to improve the user experience.

### Example of a Computer Vision Workload:
Detecting predestrians in the real-time video stream of an autonomous vehicle. Returns bounding box coordinates for pedestrians.

Detecting whether people in on-line posted images are celebrities. An ML model training with domain specific content, for example, celebrities, can determine if they are among the people detected in the online-posted images.

Generating automatic descriptions for published images. Analyzes published images and generates human readable sentences describing the image content. Sentences ae ordered by the confidence score that the model assigns to each sentence as per the visual features detected.
