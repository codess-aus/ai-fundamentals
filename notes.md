# More Notes

## Compute:

In Azure Machine Learning studio there are four kinds of compute resource you can create:
* Compute Instances: Development workstations that data scientists can use to work with data and models.
* Compute Clusters: Scalable clusters of virtual machines for on-demand processing of experiment code.
* Inference Clusters: Deployment targets for predictive services that use your trained models.
* Attached Compute: Links to existing Azure compute resources, such as Virtual Machines or Azure Databricks clusters.
